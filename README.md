Useful / interesting links and sources about Design Systems in React Native.

Companion repo to the talk I gave at the [React Native Berlin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/react-native-berlin/events/295339575/) on September 27, 2023.

# Slides

Slides are available [here](./JustWatch-Design-System.key). You will need to install the [Lato font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) (regular and italic).

# Code

You can find the Storybook projects inside the `src` folder:

- [`storybook-web`](./src/storybook-web)
- [`storybook-react-native`](./src/storybook-react-native)

I use [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage node/npm/ruby versions, so you'll find a `.tool-versions` file to setup your node versions inside each folder (yes, they use different node versions).

The projects are pretty much what you get after setting up your workspace as described by the Storybook guides, using `react-vite` for the Web setup, and the default Expo template for the React Native one. Plus, I fixed a couple of issues with dependencies that each project had. Enjoy! ðŸš€
