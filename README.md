Useful / interesting links and sources about Design Systems in React Native.

Companion repo to the talk I gave at the [React Native Berlin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/react-native-berlin/events/295339575/) on September 27, 2023.

# Code

You can find the Storybook projects inside the `src` folder:

- [`storybook-web`](./src/storybook-web)
- [`storybook-react-native`](./src/storybook-react-native)

I use [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage node/npm/ruby versions, so you'll find a `.tool-versions` file to setup your node versions inside each folder (yes, they use different node versions).
